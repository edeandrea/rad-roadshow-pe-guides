The company's goal is to help customers navigate complex financial landscapes by offering tailored insurance products and services. Recently, the company hired a new CIO and CTO, and they are pushing Parasol to modernize their business using AI technology, introducing new products, and adding features to existing products to address new market opportunities and remain competitive. The company is just getting started understanding how AI can help them and are evaluating Red Hat for their primary AI solution based on their longstanding trust and use of Red Hat’s platforms including RHEL and OpenShift.
